Observations:
1. Final tumor volumes for Capomulin and Ramicane were generally lower than final tumor volumes for Infubinol and Ceftamin. Based on this, it seems like Capomulin and Ramicane were more effective in reducing tumor volume than Infubinol and Ceftamin. 
2. The spread of final tumor volume was greater for Capomulin and Ramicane than the spread of final tumor volumes for Infubinol and Ceftamin. Based on this, it seems that effectivness in reducing tumor volume was more varied in the Capomulin and Ramicane trials than the Infubinol and Ceftamin trials. 
3. There is a positive correlation between Mouse weight and average tumor volume. Based on this, it seems likely that heavier mice will have a higher tumor volume than a mouse that weighs less.
